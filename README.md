# Kubernetes-deployment

# Description:
This project demonstrates the deployment of a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application using Kubernetes for container orchestration. The MERN stack is a popular choice for building full-stack web applications due to its flexibility and robustness. By deploying this MERN app with Kubernetes, I have showcased how to leverage containerization and orchestration to create a scalable and manageable application architecture. 

Note : I didn't develop the MERN rather used MongoDB and Docker. This repo just shows the deployment using kuberentes 

# Features:

Containerization with Docker: 
The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments and ensuring that the app runs reliably in any environment that supports Docker containers.

Kubernetes Orchestration: 
Kubernetes is used to orchestrate the deployment of the MERN app, managing the lifecycle of containers, scaling them based on demand, and ensuring high availability.

# Deployment:
The MERN app is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, which can be scaled horizontally to handle increased traffic and load. The deployment includes a MongoDB database for storing data, an Express.js backend for handling server-side logic, a React.js frontend for the user interface, and a Node.js server for running the backend logic. With this setup, the application is highly available, scalable, and can be easily maintained and updated.
